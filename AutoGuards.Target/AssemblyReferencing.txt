The reference to AutoGuards.API must be a reference to a copy of the DLL that is used by
the engine. That is, it cannot be a reference to project (otherwise the compilation fails 
becuase the refeneced AutoGaurds.DLL is already in use).
The AutoGuards.API assembly is referenced from the Libs folder.  There is a post build
task to copy the solutions AutoGuards.API assembly into this libs folder for convenience.
